# Rapunzel - Internet 2.6

I want to create new and better internet. Feeling empowered by HBO's Silicon Valley series, we set on an adventure unlike any other! Let's all together create new, open-source, decentralized, accessible and user friendly internet. Let's make the world of open-source not only for geeks, let's invite everyday folk to the party too! Back-end devs and security experts, let's create browsers and complex database structures, front-end and full-stack guys, let's create appealing UI and awesome functionality for everyone, independent on their technical knowledge. But at the same time, come and build "inside tools", like Discord bots for our community server (comming soon) or web scraper. If we all contribute with our best, we can truly make a difference. Everyone will see our every move, after all it will be done here and all the news will come directly to Twitter account (below). Let's disturb the big tech and become it. Amongst FAANG or MANGA, or however you want to call it,  we shall add Open-Source! All of you who can code usefully and have some free time come and work on this!

Come and join!
